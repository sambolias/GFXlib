CS372 Honors Project

This is the beginning of my graphics library
It currently runs using FreeGLUT and GLEW which 
can be found at freeglut.sourceforge.net and 
glew.sourceforge.net respectively.

Also uses stb_image to load images
which can be found at https://github.com/nothings/stb


Goals and Timeframes to go here.


Update Licensing/copyright information.

Start tutorial etc.
