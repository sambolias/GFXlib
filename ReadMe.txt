CS372 Honors Project

This is the beginning of my graphics library
It currently runs using FreeGLUT and GLEW which 
can be found at freeglut.sourceforge.net and 
glew.sourceforge.net respectively.

Also uses stb_image to load images
which can be found at https://github.com/nothings/stb


Have found the basis of how I want everything to work
See code to see all functionality
Added test suite to test functionality.

At this point I need to clean up the rest of 
what I have then put it all in a wrapper class
for end user to interact with.

Then back to user stories to add the rest of functionality.
To finish my user stories I plan to take the
Battleship class project from this semester
and add a GUI using my GFXlib.

This will allow me to make user stories from a realistic
end user standpoint. And will give me something to showcase
my progress, more entertaining than test suites.


Update Licensing/copyright information.

Start tutorial etc.
